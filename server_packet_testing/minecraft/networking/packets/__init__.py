'''
NOTE: The packet classes exported by this module are included only for backward
compatibility, and should not be used in new code, as (1) they do not include
all packets present in pyCraft, and (2) some are named oddly, for historical
reasons.

Use the packet classes under packets.clientbound.* and
packets.serverbound.* instead.
